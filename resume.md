### About
I'm a programmer and game designer.  Sometimes I like working on low level high performance code and sometimes I like working at a high level code that just makes a game work.  I am primarily interested in "traditional" PC/console gaming and virtual reality.

*Huh that's weird, who puts their resume in a markdown file?*

This is a reasonable question.  I don't like resumes very much and I definitely don't enjoy the process of making them.  A resume should simply be a list of accomplishments and qualifications collected and organized neatly and Markdown with its ability to easily make bulleted lists of text fits the bill nicely.

*But wait this is in a .pdf!  You're a big fat PHONY!*

Many services that accept resumes and pass them on have a limited list of extensions that they'll accept because apparently we still haven't moved on from that convention; so yes it's exported to a pdf.
